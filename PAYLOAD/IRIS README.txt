Weaknesses of logistic regression:
1. Deals with problems where the outcome can only be one of two classes (e.g., yes/no, true/false, 0/1)
2. Struggles with data where the class boundaries are not linearly separable in the feature space.
3. ensitive to feature scaling. Features with larger ranges can dominate the model if not scaled.
